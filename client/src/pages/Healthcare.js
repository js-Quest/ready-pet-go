                Vaccinations are an essential aspect of preventive healthcare for your pets. They protect them from various contagious and potentially life-threatening diseases. Common vaccines for puppies include those for distemper, parvovirus, canine hepatitis, and rabies. For kittens, common vaccines include those for feline panleukopenia, feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, and rabies.

Regular visits to the veterinarian for wellness check-ups and screenings are recommended. Your veterinarian may recommend preventive measures such as flea and tick control, heartworm prevention, and routine deworming to protect your pets from parasites.
